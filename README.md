# Face-Mask-Detection

# üò∑ Face Mask Detection Using Deep Learning and OpenCV

This project is a deep learning-based system to automatically detect whether a person is wearing a face mask or not in real-time. Built using **TensorFlow**, **Keras**, **MobileNetV2**, and **OpenCV**, this project is optimized for both training performance and real-world deployment.

## üß† Project Overview

Face mask detection has become an essential tool in maintaining public health in spaces like airports, hospitals, offices, and other public areas. This project:
- Uses **transfer learning** with **MobileNetV2**
- Achieves **99.19% accuracy** on the test dataset
- Detects faces and classifies them as `With Mask` or `Without Mask`
- Includes **real-time webcam detection**
- Future-ready for deployment on **AWS / Streamlit / Flask**

## üìÅ Dataset Structure

This project uses a dataset organized into three folders:
dataset/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ train/
‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ WithMask/
‚îÇ ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ WithoutMask/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ validation/
‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ WithMask/
‚îÇ ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ WithoutMask/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ test/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ WithMask/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ WithoutMask/

> üî¢ Total images used: **12,000+**
>  
> Source: Custom or Kaggle-based datasets (split manually into train/validation/test)

## üß± Model Architecture

We used **MobileNetV2** as the base feature extractor with custom top layers added:

- `GlobalAveragePooling2D()`
- `Dropout(0.5)`
- `Dense(128, activation='relu')`
- `Dropout(0.5)`
- `Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')`  ‚Üí Binary classifier

**Training Strategy:**
1. Freeze the base MobileNetV2 model and train the custom top layers (5 epochs)
2. Unfreeze the last 20 layers of MobileNetV2 and fine-tune the model (5 epochs)
